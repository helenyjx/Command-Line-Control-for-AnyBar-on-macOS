# Week 7 Mini Project

## Introduction
anybar_rs is a command-line application written in the Rust programming language that allows you to control the macOS Anybar application. Anybar is a small utility that adds a colored dot to your macOS menubar, which can be used for various purposes, such as indicating the status of a long-running command or notifying you when a certain event occurs. It provides a simple and convenient way to interact with Anybar from the command line. With anybar_rs, you can easily set the color and status of the Anybar dot, as well as control its visibility and animate it. This can be useful, for example, in shell scripts or automation workflows where you need to provide feedback to the user or monitor the progress of a task.
